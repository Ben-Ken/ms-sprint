These figures are generated from the same simulated data used in the original SPRiNT paper (Wilson et al., 2022) 

Here is the description taken from the SPRiNT paper: 

>"For each time series generation, we sampled the parameter values of their arhythmic/rhythmic components uniformly from realistic ranges. Aperiodic exponents were initialized between 0.8 and 2.2 Hz–1. Aperiodic offsets were initialized between –8.1 and –1.5 a.u. Within the 12–36 s time segment into the simulation (onset randomized), the aperiodic exponent and offset underwent a linear shift of magnitude in the ranges –0.5–0.5 Hz–1 and –1–1 a.u. (sampled continuously and chosen randomly), respectively. The duration of the linear shift was randomly selected for each simulated time series between 6 and 24 s. Between zero and four oscillatory (rhythmic) components were added to each trial with parameters randomly sampled within the following ranges: centre frequency: 3–35 Hz; amplitude: 0.6–1.6 a.u.; SD: 1–2 Hz. The onset (5–40 s) and duration (3–20 s) of each of the rhythmic components were also randomized across components and across trials, with the constraint that they would not overlap both in time and frequency; they were allowed to overlap in either dimension. If a rhythmic component overlapped temporally with another one, its centre frequency was set at least 2.5 peak SDs from the other temporally overlapping rhythmic component(s). The magnitude of each periodic component was tapered by a Tukey kernel (cosine fraction = 0.4)."
